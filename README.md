- **Bird Types**:
  - **Red Bird**: Standard bird with basic damage.
  - **Bomb Bird**: Explodes on command, causing massive area damage.
  - **Yellow Bird**: Faster bird that can accelerate mid-flight for greater impact.

- **Materials**:
  - Structures are built using materials such as **wood**, **glass**, and **steel**, each with unique durability and destruction mechanics.

- **Levels**:
  - A total of **three levels** are implemented, each with unique layouts, pig placements, and bird selections.
  - Levels increase in difficulty, encouraging strategy development and skill progression.

### Advanced Features
1. **Serialization**:
   - Save and load the current game state, including bird positions, structure integrity, and pig health.
   - Restore progress from saved games using an intuitive menu system.

2. **Special Abilities**:
   - Birds have unique abilities, such as the **Bomb Bird's explosion**, activated mid-flight.
   - Double-click to trigger abilities, adding depth to gameplay.

3. **Physics Simulation**:
   - Powered by **Box2D**, enabling realistic interactions between birds, pigs, and structures.

4. **Winning and Losing Conditions**:
   - Win by eliminating all pigs in the level.
   - Lose when all available birds are used without clearing the level.

5. **Interactive UI**:
   - Intuitive menus for starting new games, resuming saved games, and navigating between levels.

6. **Health and Damage**:
   - Pigs have health indicators displayed above their heads, with different damage thresholds based on their size.
   - Blocks transmit damage to structures above them upon collapse.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development, known for its versatility and portability.
- **libGDX**: A cross-platform game development framework that simplifies game creation and deployment, allowing developers to focus on game logic rather than boilerplate code.
- **SpriteBatch**: A libGDX class used for rendering images efficiently, minimizing draw calls for improved performance, particularly in graphics-intensive games.
- **Box2D**: A physics engine integrated with libGDX, used for simulating physics-based interactions in the game, providing realistic movement and collision detection.

## Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   clone the git repo
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
    - Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Preferably JDK 8 or higher.
    - Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to manage your project effectively.

3. **Import the Project**:
    - Open your IDE and import the project as a Gradle project, which will automatically resolve dependencies.

4. **Build the Project**:
    - Run the build command in your IDE or from the command line to compile the project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run the Game**:
    - Execute the main class to start the game:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

6. **Explore Game Assets**:
    - Familiarize yourself with the assets used in the game, located in the `core/assets` directory. This includes images, sounds, and other resources necessary for gameplay.

## Usage

- Launch the game to access the main menu, where you can choose to start a new game or resume a previously saved session.
- **New Game**: Select this option to start from Level 1, where you can familiarize yourself with the controls and mechanics.
- **Resume Game**: If you have a saved game, you can continue from where you left off.
- The sliders are used for setting the angle and strength of the launch, providing a more controlled and precise experience. The angle and strength of your launch will determine the outcome.
- Each level has a distinct setup of structures and pigs to defeat, encouraging players to develop and refine their strategies.

## Game Structure

### Classes

1. **AngryBirds**: The main game class responsible for initializing the game, managing the game state, and rendering graphics.
2. **Screens**:
